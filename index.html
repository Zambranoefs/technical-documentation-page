                <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>

                <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. 
                HTML consists of a series of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/element" target="_blank">elements</a>, 
                which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
                The enclosing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/tag" target="_blank">tags</a> can make a word or 
                image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, 
                take the following line of content:</p>

                <code class="codeStyle">My cat is very grumpy</code>

                <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>

                <code class="codeStyle">&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                
                <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>

                <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
                <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9347/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="parts of a p element" height="150" width="500">

                <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing 
                    angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph 
                    begins.</li>
                    <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element 
                    name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one 
                    of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
                    <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                    <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together comprise the element.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
                <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9345/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="the elements' 
                attribute" height="65" width="500">

                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, 
                <code>class</code> is the attribute name and <code>editor-note</code> is the attribute value. The class attribute allows 
                you to give the element an identifier that can be used later to target the element with style information and other things.</p>
                
                <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more 
                    attributes).</li>
                    <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                    <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters  <code>" ' ` = &lt; &gt;</code>) 
                can remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all attribute values, as it makes the code more consistent and 
                understandable.</p>


                <h3>Nesting elements</h3>
                <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy,
                we could wrap the word "very" in a <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>

                <code class="codeStyle">&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>

                <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the 
                <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element first, then the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element; therefore, we have to close the 
                <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element first, then the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. The following is incorrect:</p>

                <code class="codeStyle">&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>

                <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap 
                as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to 
                unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>


                <h3>Empty elements</h3>

                <p>Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element that we already have
                in our HTML page:</p>

                <code class="codeStyle">&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code>

                <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing <code>&lt;/img&gt;</code> tag and no inner content. This is because an image element
                doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.</p>

                
                <h3>Anatomy of an HTML document</h3>
                
                <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual 
                elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's look into the following snippet code:</p>

                <p class="codeStyleDiv">
                    <code>
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;html&gt;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/html&gt;<br>
                    </code>
                </p>

                <p>Here, we have the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><code><strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong></code> — the doctype. It is required preamble. In the mists of time, when 
                    HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to 
                    be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However these days, they don't 
                    do much, and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for 
                    now.</li>

                    <li><code><strong>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</strong></code> — the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element. This element wraps all the 
                    content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.</li>

                    <li><code><strong>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</strong></code> — the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. This element acts as a 
                    container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's 
                    viewers. This includes things like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/keyword" target="_blank">
                    keywords</a> and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set 
                    declarations and more.</li>

                    <li><code><strong>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</strong></code> — This element sets the character set your document should use
                    to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any 
                    textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>

                    <li><code><strong>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</strong></code> — the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element. This sets the title of 
                    your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page 
                    when you bookmark/favourite it.</li>

                    <li><code><strong>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</strong></code> — the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This contains all the 
                    content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, 
                    playable audio tracks or whatever else.</li>
                </ul>

             </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="images">

                <header><h2>Images</h2></header>
                    
                <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the <code>src</code> 
                (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file:</p>

                <code class="codeStyle">&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code>
               
                <p>We have also included an <code>alt</code> (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive text for 
                users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:</p> 

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>They are visually impaired.</strong> Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen 
                    readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display.</strong> For example, try deliberately changing 
                    the path inside your <code>src</code> attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see 
                    something like this in place of the image:</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="text-center"><code><strong>My test image</strong></code>

                <p>The keywords for <code>alt</code> text are "descriptive text". The <code>alt</code> text you write should provide the reader 
                with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" 
                is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding
                the Earth."</p>
                    
                <p>Try coming up with some better <code>alt</code> text for your image now.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="marking_up_text">

                <header><h2>Marking up text</h2></header>
                    
                <p>This section will cover some of the essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.</p>
               
                <h3>Headings</h3>
                <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. 
                In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles and subtitles, an HTML document can too. 
                HTML contains 6 heading levels, <code>&lt;h1&gt;–&lt;h6&gt;</code>, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
                
                <p class="codeStyleDiv">
                    <code>
                        &lt;h1&gt;My main title&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                        &lt;h2&gt;My top level heading&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
                        &lt;h3&gt;My subheading&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
                        &lt;h4&gt;My sub-subheading&lt;/h4&gt;
                    </code>
                </p>

                <p>Now try adding a suitable title to your HTML page just above your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll see that your heading level 1 has an implicit style. Don't use heading elements to make text
                bigger or bold, because they are used for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility" target="_blank">
                accessibility </a>and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#Why_do_we_need_structure"
                target="_blank"> other reasons such as SEO</a>. Try to create a meaningful sequence of headings on your pages, without 
                skipping levels.</p>

                
                <h3>Paragraphs</h3>

                <p>As explained above, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when 
                marking up regular text content:</p>

                <code class="codeStyle">&lt;p&gt;This is a single paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code>

                <p>Add your sample text into one or a few paragraphs, placed directly below your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.</p>


                <h3>Lists</h3>

                <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consist of at least
                2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Unordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. 
                    These are wrapped in a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an 
                    <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> element.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> (list item) element.</p>

                <p>For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list</p>

                <code class="codeStyle">&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders working 
                together...&lt;/p&gt; </code>

                <p>We could modify the markup to this</p>

                <p class="codeStyleDiv">
                    <code>
                        &lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we’re a global community of&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>

                        &lt;ul&gt; <br>
                        &lt;li&gt;technologists&lt;/li&gt;<br>
                        &lt;li&gt;thinkers&lt;/li&gt;<br>
                        &lt;li&gt;builders&lt;/li&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/ul&gt;<br><br>

                        &lt;p&gt;working together ... &lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Try adding an ordered or unordered list to your example page.</p>

            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="links">
                
                <header><h2>Links</h2></header>

                <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element
                — <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, 
                follow these steps:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>

                    <li>Wrap the text in an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, as shown below:</li>
                    <code class="codeStyle">&lt;a&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>

                    <li>Give the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element an href attribute, as shown below:</li>

                    <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to:</li>
                </ol>

                <code class="codeStyle">&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/"&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>

                <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the <code>https://</code> or <code>http://</code> part, called the protocol, 
                at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.</p>

                <p>href might appear like a rather obscure choice for an attribute name at first. If you are having trouble remembering it, 
                remember that it stands for hypertext reference.</p>
